## 2. Overview


### 2.1. Introduction of framework

In this study, we displayed our automated nerve detection pipeline using nerve-specific reflectance video imaging to achieve simultaneous nerve detection and demonstrate the potential clinical utility. We firstly fine-tuned the DenseNet201 model to recognize all video frames containing nerves, then nerve delineation would be performed from the previously recognized video frames containing nerves by the optimized DoubleUNet. Taking advantage of the growing varieties of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, a comparative analysis was also performed with different deep learning algorithms to recognize nerve anatomical structure and quantify the exact nerve location.

## 3. Proposed Baseline

### 3.1. Training/Testing

The training and testing experiments are conducted using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=zh-cn) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) with 
a single GeForce RTX 3080 GPU of 10 GB Memory.

> Note that our model also supports low memory GPU, which means you can lower the batch size


**1. Configuring your environment (Prerequisites):** 
   
  > Note that the pipeline is only tested on Ubuntu OS with the following environments. 
    It may work on other operating systems as well but we do not guarantee that it will.
    
  + Creating a virtual environment in terminal: `conda create -n Nerveseg python=3.7`.
    
  + Installing necessary packages: Tensorflow 1.13.1, Keras 2.3.0

  > Note that, the Official Source of Tensorflow 1.13.1 may not support the Ampere Structure GPU (NVIDIA RTX 30 Series), and you may need to download Tensorflow at the [source of NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorflow).

  + Or to apply the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


**2. Downloading necessary data:** 
  
  + Our dataset is also uploaded to Figshare. [download link (Figshare)](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20787751)

  + downloading dataset (Training, Testing and Validating) and move it into `./data/`, 
    which can be found in this [download link (Onedrive)](https://connectpolyu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/21118855r_connect_polyu_hk/EfUTJTiaiZdLs_-ZQYEoXwwBAW6GLyi0HGx4qyluNYeLXg?e=lkOcqL).
  
  + downloading external test set and move it into `./example_data/`, 
    which can be found in this [download link (Onedrive)](https://connectpolyu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/21118855r_connect_polyu_hk/EXP9pL7rdR5Pg9PoVlAtujkBZWgD4cN7tPlC9WaTaLa3yA?e=f5cmos).
    
   
**3. Training Configuration:** 

**3.1. Segmentation State-of-the-art methods:**
  
  + Please enter the Segmentation_SOTA branch. Under the folder `Seg_rawcode`:
    - Modify the file


### 3.2 Evaluating your trained model:

Python: For Classification, we use commercial software to calculate metrics. For Segmentation, the evaluation code is `dice_iou.py`.
